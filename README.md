# JetBrains-test-task
This directory contains the results of the JetBrains test task.

The analytical report is in Google Docs, access via the link (you can leave comments if you want): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g4SuPitjmh2tdccmW5Gr8V7nniKkqyCkdn12j1mvu0Y/edit?tab=t.0

The main data processing was done in the Jupiter laptop **"Jetbrains.ipynb"**. At the beginning there is a table of contents based on which you can navigate through the questions of the test task.

I also attach **'build_model.py'** that contains one function for training the model, I took it out separately, since it was necessary to reuse a large amount of code.
